            Pneumonia detection involves identifying the type of Pneumonia a person may have, which typically falls into two categories: latent Pneumonia infection and active Pneumonia disease. Latent Pneumonia infection means the bacteria are present in the body but are inactive, causing no symptoms and not being contagious. Active Pneumonia disease, on the other hand, indicates that the bacteria are multiplying in the body, leading to symptoms such as coughing, fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Diagnosis often includes a combination of tests like skin or blood tests, chest X-rays, and sputum tests to determine whether Pneumonia is present and, if so, whether it is latent or active. Treatment varies based on the type detected, with latent Pneumonia often requiring medication to prevent it from becoming active, while active Pneumonia usually necessitates a more intensive treatment regimen to cure the disease, with an accuracy of up to 98%.
